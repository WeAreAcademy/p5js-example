# p5js-example
Example index.html and p5js "sketch" for those interested in experimenting in vscode.

# installation / running:
1. open the project in vscode
2. [Install the Live Server vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. right click on index.html
4. choose "open with live server" (or similar)
5. this should automatically launch your browser to view the html file which in turn will load the sketch
6. edit mySketch.js and save the changes - you should immediately be able to observe the changes in the browser.
7. look for errors in the browser js console

Please note we DO NOT use Live Server at all for React development!
